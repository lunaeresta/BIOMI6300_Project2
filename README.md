This is the notes for BIOMI6300 Project 2.

This project is built based on a 2021 paper by Ang et al entitled "The East Asian gut microbiome is distinct from colocalized White subjects and connected to metabolic health".

The fastq files to be used for this project can be found on NCBI, BioProject PRJNA665061.

They contain 16-S sequencing results from 46 human stools taken from East Asian and White participants living in the San Francisco Bay Area.

The hypotheses that I will explore are:
1. That alpha diversity (represented by hill numbers) are significantly different between ethnic groups.
2. That White individuals were enriched for the mucin-degrading bacteria, Akkermansia muciniphila.
3. That East Asians have higher relative abundance of short chain fatty acids-producing bacteria.
