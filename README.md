This is the notes for BIOMI6300 Project 2.

This is the analysis of 16S sequencing output from Dwiyanto et al, 2021, “Ethnicity influences the gut microbiota of individuals sharing a geographical location: a cross-sectional study from a middle-income country”

The fastq files to be used for this project can be found on NCBI, BioProject number PRJNA631204.
The accession numbers used (n=12) are: SRR11741879, SRR11741882, SRR11741890, SRR11741901, SRR11741916, SRR11741912, SRR11741913, SRR11741894, SRR11741896, SRR11741906, SRR11741885, SRR11741922.

They contain 16-S sequencing results of human stools taken from Native, Malay, Chinese and Indian participants living in Johor, Malaysia.

The question and hypotheses explored in this analysis are:
* Question: Do different ethnicities have different microbiome profiles, after controlling for other demographic factors?
* Hypothesis: Ethnicity exhibited the largest effect size across participants, which is retained after controlling for all other variables. Moreover, the Chinese ethnic group will have a high proportion of Bifidobacteria, while the Indian ethnic group will have a high proportion of Prevotella
